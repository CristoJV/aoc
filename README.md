## 🚀 Progress

This table tracks my progress for each year, showing:
- **Day**: The challenge number (1–25).
- **Status**: Completion status, where:
  - ⭐⭐ → Both parts solved
  - ⭐▶️ → Part 1 solved, Part 2 in progress
  - ⭐ → Only Part 1 solved
  - ⬜ → Not attempted yet
- **Strategy**: The key approach used for solving each part of the challenge.

| 1️⃣3️⃣ | ⭐⭐ |  |  |
| 1️⃣4️⃣ | ⭐⭐ | **Modular Arithmetic** | **2D Entropy using Kernel-based Joint Histogram** <br> This approach evaluates local spatial dependencies using a 5-pixel cross-shaped kernel: {(center, top, right, bottom, left)}. The joint histogram is built from these patterns, forming a probability distribution. The key insight was detecting the image with minimum entropy to reveal the hidden Christmas tree. |
| 1️⃣5️⃣ | ⭐⭐ | **Recursion** |  |
| 1️⃣6️⃣ | ⭐⭐ |  |  |
| 1️⃣7️⃣ | ⭐⭐ |  |  |
| 1️⃣8️⃣ | ⭐⭐ |  |  |
| 1️⃣9️⃣ | ⭐⭐ |  |  |
| 2️⃣0️⃣ | ⭐▶️| **Djistra** <br> Using array indexing instead of complex dictionaries. The algorithm precomputes two cost maps: one tracking the shortest path from the start to all points and another from the end to all points. To handle potential shortcuts, the total cost for each one is determined by summing the cost from the start to the shortcut's entry and the cost from the end to the shorcut's exit, considering both possible directions.|  |
| 2️⃣1️⃣ | ⬜ |  |  |
| 2️⃣2️⃣ | ⭐⭐ | **Memoization** | ⚡ Could by optimized by skipping redundant price iterations |
| 2️⃣3️⃣ | ⭐ | **Lexicographic ordering** <br> Processing nodes in a fixed order (i.e. alphabetically) to avoid redundant computations when detecting triangle cycles. |  |
| 2️⃣4️⃣ | ⭐ |  |  |
| 2️⃣5️⃣ | ⭐ | ⚡ Parsing the input into locks and keys could be optimized |  |
